# Data_Analysis_with_Northwind_DB

Project: Exploring Data Analysis with Northwind DB

### Project Summary

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Northwind database, a classic dataset that simulates a global food import/export company's operations. The goal of this analysis is to uncover key business insights by examining sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and employee efficiency.

Through SQL queries and data visualization techniques, I explore how different business elements interact — from orders and customers to employees and suppliers. This project demonstrates my ability to work with relational databases, clean and analyze data, and communicate findings clearly.
