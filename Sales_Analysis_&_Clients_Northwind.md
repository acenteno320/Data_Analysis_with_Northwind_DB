The following stages will be developed to carry out the data analysis process using the Northwind database:<br/>

Stage 1: Understanding the Context<br/>
– Review of the Northwind data model and analysis objectives.<br/>

Stage 2: Data Preparation and Cleaning<br/>
– Identification of relevant tables and relationships.<br/>
– Review of data consistency.<br/>

Stage 3: Exploratory Analysis Using SQL Queries<br/>
– Analysis of sales by employee, top-selling products, and tables needed for queries.<br/>

Stage 4: Visualization in Power BI<br/>
– Creation of dashboards with bar charts, line graphs, and KPIs.<br/>

Stage 5: Conclusions and Recommendations<br/>
– Key insights and how they can support business decision-making.<br/>

## Executing the Process

### Stage 1 : Analyzing Objectives<br/>
For this stage, we define the objectives clear and precise of the information that we want to obtain at the end in our reports of visualizations. <br>

Analyze Northwind's sales and customer database to gain key insights into:<br>
1.Best-selling products<br/>
2.Sales distributioni by region<br/>
3.Highest-performing employees<br/>
4.Most frequent customers<br/>
5.Average sales by product category<br/>

### Stage 2: Data Preparation and Cleaning<br/>
At this stage, the Northwind database is already clean, with well-defined relationships and consistent data. No additional data cleaning was required.<br/>


### Stage 3: Exploratory Analysis Using SQL Queries<br/>
The following are the different queries executed to retrieve the information needed to address the defined objectives.<br> 

a.) Total Sales by Region. <br/>
Objective : View total sales by country and the most productive region.<br/>
